###Web Infrastructure – API
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on consuming a REST API using Python instead of Bash scripting. As modern Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), we use programming languages like Python to interact with APIs, process data, and export it into structured formats such as CSV and JSON.

The project uses the JSONPlaceholder API to retrieve employee TODO list information and organize it into different data structures.
